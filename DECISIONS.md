# DECISIONS — YouTube Production

This file records project decisions separately from hypotheses. Items marked **Hypothesis** remain open to evidence.

## D-001 — Proven content is evidence, not a template to copy

**Status:** Accepted

Use successful videos to identify demonstrated demand and transferable mechanisms. Do not treat the source video itself as the production blueprint.

Core principle:

> **Copy the demonstrated demand, not the video.**

## D-002 — Use the Source Dependency Test

**Status:** Accepted

A transformed concept should retain its main value even if borrowed clips are removed. If its script, argument, story, research, or insight collapses without the source footage, it is too dependent on the source.

Selective source footage may still be useful as evidence or illustration, subject to rights/licensing/copyright review.

## D-003 — Separate Opportunity from Retention

**Status:** Accepted

The system has two distinct questions:

- **Opportunity:** What is worth making?
- **Retention:** How should it be presented?

Do not use retention mechanics as a substitute for demand research, or demand metrics as a substitute for creative construction.

## D-004 — Long-form and Shorts require separate format logic

**Status:** Accepted

They may share research and a master story package, but Shorts should not simply be chopped long-form videos and long-form should not inherit Shorts assumptions.

## D-005 — No final opportunity score in Experiment 01.1

**Status:** Accepted

Measure Demand, Breakout, Momentum proxy, baseline quality, and format independently first. Inspect the full dataset before defining a composite score or ranking model.

## D-006 — Rename velocity measurement honestly

**Status:** Accepted

`views / age_days` is **average views per day over the video's lifetime**, not current velocity.

True velocity requires repeated snapshots separated in time.

## D-007 — Duration is only a format heuristic

**Status:** Accepted

A video of 180 seconds or less may be labelled `short_candidate` for research, but the system must not claim that duration alone proves YouTube classified it as a Short.

## D-008 — Retention-engineering rules are hypotheses until tested

**Status:** Accepted

Claims such as:

- hook at 0–3 seconds;
- secondary hook at 15–20 seconds;
- visual reset every 3–5 seconds;
- fixed retention targets;
- a single universally dominant ranking signal;

must not become hard production rules solely because creator/vendor literature recommends them.

Experiment 02 will test which mechanisms appear consistently in successful source content.

## D-009 — Current demand thresholds remain hypotheses

**Status:** Hypothesis

Reference values currently under test:

- analysis floor: 500K views;
- long-form reference: 1M views;
- short-candidate reference: 5M views.

These values are not yet frozen.

## D-010 — Channel-relative breakout is useful but insufficient alone

**Status:** Hypothesis supported by initial test

Large outlier ratios can identify unusual performance, but small channel baselines can produce misleading ratios. Baseline sample size and warnings must accompany the ratio.

Full 30-query evidence is still required.

## D-011 — OpenMontage is production infrastructure, not the creative brain

**Status:** Accepted

Discovery, why-it-worked analysis, transformation, research, story, and format decisions should occur upstream. OpenMontage or equivalent tooling belongs in the Production Engine.

## D-012 — Build incrementally

**Status:** Accepted

Current milestone is **M1 — Prove the Opportunity Engine**.

Do not build all planned engines simultaneously. Each new layer should address a demonstrated requirement or failure.

## D-013 — Generated experiment output remains untracked for now

**Status:** Accepted

Keep API secrets and generated experiment output out of Git:

- `.env`
- `experiment_01_discovery/output/`

Source code, configuration, project documentation, and validated decisions belong in the repository. Evidence-storage policy can be revisited when repeated experiments need versioned datasets.

## Next decision gate

Run the full 30-query Experiment 01.1 dataset and review its distributions.

Questions for that gate:

1. Does the 500K collection floor retain enough useful candidates?
2. Are the 1M/5M reference thresholds informative?
3. How stable is channel-relative breakout across niches?
4. How often are baseline warnings triggered?
5. How should recency and lifetime average view rate be represented?
6. Is a composite score justified at all?
7. Which candidates should enter Experiment 02?
